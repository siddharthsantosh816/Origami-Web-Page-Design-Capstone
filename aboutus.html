                <div class = "bodyus">
                        Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. In modern usage, the
                       word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of
                        origin.The goal is to transform a flat square sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through 
                        folding and sculpting techniques. The best-known origami model is the Japanese paper crane.
